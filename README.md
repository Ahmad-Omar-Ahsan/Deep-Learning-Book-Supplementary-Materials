# Deep-Learning-Book-Supplementary-Materials

This is a part of the community curated & created support materials for [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org). All credits for knowledge and resources goes to the amazing authors and contributors. 

## Motivation:

The Deep Learning Book is an incredible resource to get started with understanding the basics and theoretical groundwork behind Deep Learning. However, currently it doesn't have any pythonic examples by design or any assignment materials. 
The goal of this repository is to fill the gaps and provide the same materials for the community. 

This is being built as a part of the community livestreams:

- [Link to YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChaiTimeDataScience)
- [Link to lecture 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwgK7bA-QtY)

First Notebook will be uploaded after the livestream, any/all community contributions are welcome! The goal is to learn together with everyone üôè
